    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div id="frontpage-intro">
      <p align="justify">This online course is designed as part of the <span>Bachelor Research Skills</span> course for third year physics students at Leiden university. The purpose of this course is to prepare students to the use of data analysis methods that they will need during their research project. Students should have a working knowledge of <span>Python</span> and he use of <span>Jupyter notebooks</span>. The focus of this course is on the interpretation of fit results, error bars and possible pitfalls and difficulties that are frequently encountered during experimental research. I assume that students have already used a computer to visualize their data and have done non-linear least square fitting of data using a standard python library, e.g. <span>SciPy</span>.</p>

	<div id="frontpage-intro">
		<p align="justify">This course consists of two modules that each contain a part A and part B. Each part is designed to take 1-1.5 hour to complete and contains a combination of quizzes using <span>Google forms</span>, some instruction videos and a set of <span>Jupyter notebooks</span> with detailed instructions, lecture notes etc. In principle these modules can be completed individually and independently, but discussion in small groups of 2-5 students is highly recommended.</p>
		<br>
		<p align="justify">For physics students at Leiden university <span>live sessions</span> are planned for each part. These sessions will consist of 30 min. of interactive lecture/discussion on part A of each module. Short instructions and a question and answer session is available for the B part of the module afterwards. Students are expected to come prepared by completing the A part of each module. The B part of each module contains at least one exercise that needs to be handed in.</p>

		<span>Module 1A // Data analysis, mistakes and misconduct</span>
		<br> <br> 
		After completing this module the student:<br>
		- is able to name and explain <span>ethical guidelines</span> for conducting scientific research; <br>
		- is able to <span>distinguish</span> between <span>scientific mistakes</span> and <span>scientific misconduct</span>;<br>
		- can give a few examples of scientific mistakes and misconduct and discuss these with others<br>

		<span>Module 1B // Errors, hypothesis testing and goodness of fit</span>
		<br> <br>
		In this module students learn to the statisitical methods of hypothesis testsing.<br>
		More specifically, the student can: <br>
		- calculate the <span>chi-squared value</span> and use this to <span>test a hypothesis</span>;<br>
		- asses the <span>quality of a fit</span> using the chi-squared dsitribution;<br>
		- dicuss the differences between various methods to <span>fit a straight line</span><br>

		<span>Module 2A // Non-linear-least-squares fitting</span>
		<br> <br>
		This module contains three examples that teach the student to:<br>
		- apply <span>non-linear-least-squares fitting</span> in different settings;<br>
		- use the <span>method of error propagation</span> to calculate the error bar on a data point and <span>discuss the consequences</span> for non-linear-least-squares fitting;<br>
		- understand the importance of <span>initial parameters</span> and find the overall best fit parameters;<br>

		<span>Module 2B // Global warming in the Netherlands?</span>
		<br> <br>
		The goal of this module is to analyze a large online dataset using <span>Pandas</span>.<br>
		After completion the student is able to: <br>
		- use Pandas (in Python) on <span>large online datasets</span>.<br>
		- have an informed opinion whether or not the <span>rise in temperature in the Netherlands</span> over the past century is statistically significant.<br>
		- apply <span>all the skills</span> from all above modules to complete this final exercise.<br>
