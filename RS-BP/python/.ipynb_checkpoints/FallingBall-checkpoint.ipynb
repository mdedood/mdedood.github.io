    "# Exercise 3: Determining the gravitational constant\n",
    "\n",
    "We try to determine the gravitational constant $g$ from an experiment. In the experiment a small metal sphere is released from an adjustable height $h$ and the time to reach the ground is recorded. The sphere is held in place by an electro-magnet and is dropped at time $t = 0$ using a switch that simultaneously starts a measurement of the time. The measurement is stopped when the sphere reaches the ground and thus the time is recorded. There are possible delays in both the moment that the electro-magnet releases the ball and the starting and stopping of the time recording device. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated measurements for different initial heights result in a set of data that we can compare to the known relation \n",

    "The data is stored in the file [timeandheight.dat](timeandheight.dat) and is in comma separated format. We will first read in the data using the numpy loadtxt function."
