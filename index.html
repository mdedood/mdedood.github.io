                      <p>A superconductor can transport current up to a maximum critical current without the current experiencing electrical resistance. A Josephson junction is created when a very thin insulator is inserted between two superconductors. Some current can tunnel through the insulator that depends on the phase difference between the two superconductors. This phase difference is transcribed by the junction to a voltage and the effect can be used to created superconducting qubits and extremely sensitive magnetic field sensors (SQUIDs). 
					  PhD student Xingchen Chen together with M.Sc. student Mio Poortvliet explored superconducting Josephson junctions created by stacking two flakes of the van der Waals material NbSe<sub>2</sub>. The junction properties depend on the area of the junction and the magnetic field. The key result of their work, published in Phys. Rev. B, is that the properties of the junctions are also very sensitive to the shape of the junction, which explains the imperfections observed in the magnetic-field-dependent critical current of these junctions. </p>

                      <p>Our article on imaging moiré patterns in twisted bilayer graphene with Low Energy Electron Microscopy was published in Nature Communications. These twisted bilayers form when two flakes of graphene are stacked on top of eachother with a small twist angle between the layers. The stacked flakes with each a regular hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms create a superlattice or moiré pattern. For a specific magic angle of 1.1 degree new exciting physics emerges and flat bands are created that lead to superconductivity at low temperatures. PhD students Tobias de Jong, Tjerk Benschop and Xing Chen studied spatial and temporal variations in the moiré pattern using Low Energy Electron Microscopy. They report smaller spatial variation than reported previously and observe thermal fluctuations corresponding to collective atomic displacements over 70 pm on a timescale of seconds. Surprisingly, no untwisting is found up to temperatures of 900 K showing that thermal annealing could be used to decrease local disorder. </p>

                      <p>Superconducting single photon detectors detect single photons efficiently, but are much less sensitive to multiple photons. This is particularly true for longer nanowires when biased at low currents. In this regime multiple photons need to be absorbed at the same position along the wire to create a detection event. Our paper, published today in Applied Physics Letters, uses this effect and quanifies the reducation in multiphoton efficiency in short NbN nanowires. These data can be used to quantify the finite hotspot interaction length resulting in a value of 23 +/- 2 nm.</p>

                      <p>Surface plasmon lasers require gain and feedback. In our metal hole arrays the gain is provided by an optically pumped InGaAs semiconductor while feedback is generated by in-plane scattering of plasmons on a periodic array of holes in the gold layer. We describe the surface plasmon dispersion relation in terms of scattering coefficients for a complete collection of hexagonal, honeycomb and Kagome lattices. Unlike square lattices, the hexagonal family of lattices provides opportuities of complete two-dimensional feedback which may lead to new lasing behavior in metal hole arrays.</p>

WSi meandering wires have a higher reported efficiency as compared to similar device made out of NbN and a question arises if this is due to the morphology of the material and other technical issues or becuase the physics of photon detection is fundamentally different. Given our current understanding of photon detection in NbN we would expect a non-linear depends of the threshold current on photon energy because of the significantly smaller superconducting gap of WSi. Our experiments show a convincing linear dependence with an onset of non-linear behavior for energies below 0.8 eV.</p>

Plasmons, travelling on a metal hole array on top of a gain medium can thus be used to create plasmonic lasing. The properties of these lasers were not well understood and the amount of experimental data available to improve models of plasmonic lasing was limited.

		      <p>Quantum detector tomogrpahy is an important tool to obtain the probability of multi-photon detection events. The purpose of tomography is to obtian these probabilities in an agnostic way so that understanding of the physics of photon detection is shifted towards the interpretation of these detection probabilities. In a real experiment that is affected by noise it is not clear how accurately these probabilities can be determined. In a recent publication we address how this accuracy can be determined and discuss the various factors that affect tomography on NbN detectors.  </p>

		      <p>To unravel the detection mechanism of superconducting single photon detectors we used the fact that light is non-uniformly absorbed for different polarizations of the incoming field. Microscopic models of the detection mechanism predict that the response of these detectors depends on the position where the photon is absorbed. With the aid of tomographic methods we are the first to measure this nanoscale response of the detector and are able to quantitatively explain the response of technoligcally relevant devices. This research, recently published in Nano Letters, reveals the physical mechanism of photon-assited vortex entry as being responsible for the less than one internal detection efficiency of state-of-the-art detectors. </p>

		      <p>When a superconducting single photon detector is placed in a magnetic field the response of these devices is altered. We have performed an experiment on the simplest possible detector that consists of a single constriction. This rules out geometric effects that may affect the response and reveals that an increase in magentic field does not improve detector performance. More importantly these results report an exchange between magentic field and current and show that the mechanism of generating dark counts is fundamentally different from detecting single photons.
