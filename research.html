					<p>Classical optics describes light as waves which makes explaining the physical phenomenon of
                                        interference easy. In a quantum description light can be thought to consist of individual particles
                                        that are called photons. Obviously, this quantum mechanical picture based on photons must be equally valid.
                                        Each light particle carries a very small, but well-defined, amount of energy. Detecting a single photon is a
                                        formidable technological challenge but can be solved by modern single photon counting detectors that produce a
                                        'click' whenever they detect a photon.</p>

                                        <p>In experiments with single photons the behaviour of light regime is exactly predicted
                                        by the wave description of classical optics. Interference patterns (a typical wave phenemenon) emerge from
                                        the count statistics of the photons (as particles). In order to find effects that go beyond the realm of classical optics and are
                                        not easily explained by the wave picture one needs to investigate correlations between two or more photons.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In the quantum optics group at Leiden University we produce such special quantum states of light that 
                                        contain two (or more) photons that are strongly correlated because they were created in a single process in the
                                        same crystal. For this purpose we use a nonlinear optical process called spontaneous parametric down-conversion that splits
                                        a single blue photon into two red photons, albeit with an overwhelmingly small probability. The process is called
                                        spontaneous as there is no obvious cause for the blue photon to decay into two lower energy photons.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The pairs produced by down-conversion have proven to be very useful in fundamental tests of quantum
                                        mechanics by violating Bell's inequalities. Using entangled photons these inequalities can be violated  
                                        and no (classical) theories with local hidden variables can be constructed that explain the measured correlations
                                        between a property (e.g. polarization) of the photon. It is impossible to predict the outcome of a measurement on
                                        one particle, but if we measure a property of one particle we know with 100% certainty the outcome of the measurement
                                        on the other particle. To explain this we can use 'standard' quantum theory where a single wavefunction is used to
                                        described both particles. This wavefucntion contains a superposition of two (or more) states of the two photons. 
                                        Each of these states represents a classical correlation between the two particles, but the superpostion state 
                                        describes all possibilities simultaneously for the two photons together. Quantum mechanics postulates that a 
                                        measurement on one particle collapses the wavefunction to one of the classically correlated states.</p>

                                        <p>Similar reasoning has been used to show that the states of quantum particles cannot be copied and that the
                                        physical process of measurement changes the wavefunction that describes the particles. These insights make these
                                        photons an essential resource in quantum information and communication as well as in quantum computation.</p>

					<p>A surface plasmon, or plasmon-polariton is an electromagnetic wave that can exist on the interface between
                                        an insulating material and a good metal. The free electrons of the metal are accelerated by the field of the
                                        surface plasmon creating a coupled wave of electromagnetic field and charge density fluctuations on the metal
                                        surface.</p>

                                        <p>These surface plasmons have received a lot of attention because they could become highly confined to the
                                        surface. Among others, this could be usefull in sensing application, non-linear optical studies or high
                                        resolution imaging. We have studied such surface plasmons on so-called metal hole arrays: a thin film of metal
                                        perforated by a regular array of subwavelength holes. The individual holes are not expected to transmit
                                        light because the holes are smaller than the wavelength of light. However, all the holes together do transmit
                                        much more light than expected. This phenemenon, first discovered by Thomas Ebessen and coworkers, is called
                                        extra-ordinary transmission and works because the holes on the regular grid couple the incoming light to the
                                        surface plasmon.</p>

					<p>Photonic crystals are special optical materials that have a periodic variation in their refractive
                                        index on a length scale that is comparable to the wavelength of light. By far the easiest and most
                                        widespread example of such a material is a dielectric or Bragg mirror. These mirrors consist of alternating
                                        layers of high and low refractive index material. At each boundary between the two layers optical reflection 
                                        occurs. If the layer thickness is tuned carefully so that the reflected light of each of the layers is
                                        exactly in phase constructive interference occurs and eventually all light will be reflected far a sufficient
                                        number of layers. This principle is commonly used in commercial dielectric mirrors that have high reflectivity
                                        that easily surpasses the reflectivity of metal mirrors. Such high reflectivity mirrors are an essential
                                        component in lasers.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>However, the concept of periodic dielectrics is not limited to one-dimensional stacks of layers.</p>
